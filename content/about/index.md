I am a Java Developer with over 8 years enterprise-level application development experience.
Low key, pragmatic, skeptical, late-bloomer, acting more than talking and probably not as smart as I think I am. He/ him. 
I love:
- peaceful life;
- reading; blogging;
- travelling sometimes; 
- studying history; 
- playing video games (big fan of city builder games like Cities: Skyline, Anno 1800, The Sims, Tropico) 
- and getting jealous of people who can sing, dance, or paint.

I have learned a lot since I've started blogging, so I might contradict views I've previously expressed. I always reserve the right to change my mind, so don't be surprised if I do.

I am at the bottom of the world, welcome to the South Pacific and the land of the long white cloud - New Zealand.
